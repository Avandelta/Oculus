# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

A code of conduct, also called privacy and code of conduct, are the policies and rules both contributors and maintaners must adhere to. These guidelines outline how contributors should appropriately interact with one another at work.

## Preamble

Project was created to foster an open, innovative and inclusive community around open source idea. To clarify expected behaviour in communities maintaners have adopted the [Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org/). This code of conduct has been adopted by [many other open source communities](http://contributor-covenant.org/adopters/) and maintaners feel it expresses their values well. 

Community Impact Guidelines were inspired by [Mozilla’s code of conduct enforcement ladder](https://github.com/mozilla/diversity).

## Pledge

Members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

Contributors pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Behaviour

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.
