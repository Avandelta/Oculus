… welcome to the official documentation of this project for both juristical and in-game purposes: the in-game rules and regulations governing other administrative aspects, as well as user agreements and other documents, are all stored here.

#### Introduction

Any juristical documentation, which is stored in public access in this repository — is genuine and distributes its offer only to users that have registered an account on this project website: respectively third-party users cannot edit those documents.

Documentation is kept in the public domain for two reasons: one of them is technical and the other is consistent with the projects attitude towards open source policy — in case of talking about the technical purpose, then thanks to this system, the website can dynamically update documents on the page itself, in accordance with the laws of the country in which the project is contained, so the project supports the open source philosophy — we ourselves use some source code and want to do our part to help us.

#### Dependencies

Files are strictly separated into directories that are in this project — this is due to both technical and graphical purposes: as, for example, directories which are associated with files containing translations of related documents are in the corresponding language folders.

— the project wants to warn that its official jurisprudence is distributed in russian and communicates to citizens of the post-soviet space.

Some files and directories come from other projects: therefore, to avoid jural conflicts with the primary authors of the content, the project uses a system of sublicenses — special licenses which could edit the main repository licensing policy and only extend their offer to subdirectories which contain this license.

… the project welcomes support from the community in resolving juristical inconsistencies or other deficiencies — the project respects and tries to support inaugural content as much as possible and does not try to copyright content that does not belong to it.

#### License

Any contact information is either contained in the juristical documents themselves — or in a special file with uplined name: if you are a foreign-language user you can create an account and write the necessary question on the forum.

Content which developed by the project and its developers is distributed strictly under the license of the given repository as indicated in the repository file: all content that belongs to third parties belongs only to them either their publishers.

— License is written with help and based on the MS-PL by Microsoft.
