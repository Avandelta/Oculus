## Contributioning

In the first terms to the any possible contributor: before creating a contribution to this project — ensure that the main language of the documentation is in russian because of the territory of its legal validity.

Any contributor must know that the fact of editing the any version of jural documentation will require review of the any developer from the projects developer team: excluding in-game documentation and files of the repository.

#### Contributing the repository files

1. Fork current repository.
2. Clone the repository with help of different REST-clients alike SSH and HTTPS.
3. Make your changes.
4. Run GRADLE-command for applying automatic code formatting.
5. Stage any made changes in cloned repository.
6. Push for forked repository.
7. Create a pull-request.
8. Squash commits for cleaner history.

For one-single file contributioning pull-requests, use a more quicker way without cloning of fork.

#### Contributing the jural files

As it said before: contributor in the terms of legal validity just can't simply contribute to the jural valid documentation — but still any contributor could help with this documents quality and visuals.

Contributioning to the different consecutive interpretations of the jural documentation are not restricted with this rules: but its highly recommended to apply some dictionary information about your edits.
